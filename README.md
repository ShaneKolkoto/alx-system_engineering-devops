## What is Shell?

> Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

> On most Linux systems a program called <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/bash1.html"><b>`bash`</b></a> (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, `sh`, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: `ksh`, `tcsh` and `zsh`.

## What's a "Terminal?

> It's a program called a terminal emulator. This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. There are a bunch of different terminal emulators we can use. Some Linux distributions install several. These might include `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xterm`, `rxvt`, `kvt`, `nxterm`, and `eterm`.

## Starting a Terminal

> Window managers usually have a way to launch a terminal from the menu. Look through the list of programs to see if anything looks like a terminal emulator. While there are a number of different terminal emulators, they all do the same thing. They give us access to a shell session. You will probably develop a preference for one, based on the different bells and whistles it provides.
